When output files are saved at a centralized location, we can display them from the web application or easily access them from scripts.

## Where is the data saved?
- **Metadata** on outputs, commits, etc is managed by the QA-Board server with postgresql.
- **Local runs**'s output files  are saved in the *local* current directory under `output/`.
- **Shared runs**'s output files (`qa --share`) are saved at a centralized location managed by QA-Board.
- **Artifacts** are saved at a centralized location. It makes it possible to start tuning experiments from QA-Board.

QA-Board saves the data under:

```yaml title="qaboard.yaml"
storage: /mnt/qaboard/
```

In most cases that's all you need, so you can skip to the next page!

### Split storage for output and artifacts
In some cases you want to separate the storage of outputs and artifacts (maybe to comply with quota policies...):
```yaml
storage:
  outputs: /mnt/qaboard/outputs
  artifacts: /mnt/qaboard/artifacts
```

:::note
To access non-default storage locations from QA-Board, make sure they are mounted. Refer to [the server bringup docs](/deploy#create-a-directory-to-store-results)

### Dealing with different mount names on Windows
```yaml
storage:
  linux: /mnt/qaboard
  windows: //shared/qaboard
```

### Using variables in storage locations
You can use `project`, `subproject` `{user}`, and their attributes. For instance:

```yaml
storage:
  artifacts: /mnt/{subproject.parts[0]}/artifacts
  outputs:
    linux: /mnt/{subproject.name}/outputs/{user}
    windows: //shared/{subproject.name}/outputs/{user}
```


:::note
Avoid using `{user}` for the artifacts location: you want some stability for this!
Even if you use `{user}` for outputs, if you ran a first tuning as a user then with a second as another, you'll lose easy access to files related to the 1st tuning.... It's usually not really a big deal as we're just talking about the STDOUT of `qa batch`...

**TODO:** Maybe `{user}` should evaluate to the current user name for outputs and to the committer name for artifacts.

## Accessing Storage locations programmatically
In *qaboard.config.py* the location where things are stored is defined via:

| variable                | sample value                                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `artifacts_root`        | `/mnt/qaboard`                                        |
| `artifacts_project`     | `/mnt/qaboard/your/project`                           |
| `artifacts_commit_root` | `/mnt/qaboard/your/project/commits/$hash/subproject`  |
| `artifacts_commit`      | `/mnt/qaboard/your/project/commits/$hash`             |
| `artifacts_branch`      | `/mnt/qaboard/your/project/branches/branch-slug`      |

> Similarly, there are also: `outputs_root`, `outputs_project`, `outputs_commit`, `outputs_commit_root`.

:::tip
In your CI, you can save e.g. coverage reports at `$(qa get artifacts_branch)`, and make them easily [accessible as links](https://samsung.github.io/qaboard/docs/triggering-third-party-tools) as sidebar menus with `href: /s/mnt/qaboardyour/project/branches/{commit.branch_slug}/coverage`.

We could simplify that API a tiny bit with e.g. `href: "{branch.artifacts}/coverage"`...
