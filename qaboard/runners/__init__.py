## We may not want to promote this, better have people contribute more runners to the project,
## rather than encourage everyone to write their own wrapper. Also it lets us keep the API internal.
## Besides, when we call stop_command server-side, having custom runners makes things even more complex
# def register_runner(runnerType):
#     assert hasattr(runnerType, 'type')
#     assert hasattr(runnerType, 'start_jobs')
#     assert hasattr(runnerType, 'stop_jobs')
#     runners[runnerType.type] = runnerType
