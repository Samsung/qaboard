  # The latest commit on this branch is used for as default reference when comparing results

# Default settings (can be overridden per run...)
inputs:
  # We assume your inputs are located at $database/$input. [read the docs for other options...]
  database:
    # Often databases are mounted at different locations on linux and windows...
    linux: /
    windows: C://
    # TODO: - List those mappings under storage.mapping[{linux,windows}]

  # What kind of inputs do you have? images? folders containing images?
  # To find them automaticall when you run `qa batch my/folder`, you need to provide a way to identify them:
  # globs: '*.jpg'
  # It is sometimes nicer to identify the folder containing a matching path as the input;
  # for instance if you identify inputs as folders with a file named "Frame_000.jpg":
  # use_parent_folder: false


  # For complex projects, you want to distinguish different types of inputs (eg images, movies...)
  # types:
  #   default: image
  #   image:
  #     globs: '*.raw'
  #     use_parent_folder: false
  #   movie:
  #     globs: 'Frame_000.jpg'
  #     use_parent_folder: true


  # You can define files containing definitions of batches of tests,
  # which you run with `qa batch`
  batches:
  - qa/batches.yaml


  # Your code runs on an inputs + a list of configurations (default: empty list).
  # You are free to give any meaning to your configurations. In the wild we see setups like:
  # configurations:       # each element provides a partial config, merged with earlier ones
  # - base                # read config/{base}.yaml
  # - /path/to/delta.yaml # read from absolute paths for convenience
  # - key: value          # give directly parameters...



outputs:
  # Each metric should have a label, a quality treshold, a scale, unit...
  # It is all defined in this file
  metrics: qa/metrics.yaml

  # To learn more about how to describe how results should be visualized:
  # http://qa-docs/docs/visualizations
  visualizations:
  # - name: My image
  #   path: output.jpg

  # - name: My plot
  #   # path: data.plotly.json
  #   ## If you use plotly, it is very simple to view yours plots in the web UI
  #   ## Save your plot's data and layout in a json file
  #   ## Note: To find the data they will display, some viewers might rely on conventions
  #   ##       but it is best to be explicit
  #   # type: plotly/json
  #   ## {
  #   ##   layout: {...},        // regular plotly layout
  #   ##   data: [{...}, {...}]  // data (array) of regular plotly traces
  #   ## }
  #   #
  #   ## You can hide by defaut your debug/heavy outputs
  #   # default_hidden: false
  #
  #   ## If you add parameters, they will be passed down to the viewer
  #   ## For instance, you may want to adjust optionnal displays, styling, etc.
  #   ## Each viewer will have its own options....
  #   #


  # You pass CSS style attributes to your viewers' container
  # here we instance we change the visualizations' width 
  # style:
  #   width: 840px

  # The UI lets you define controls that pass parameters down to all viewers
  # controls:
  #   - type: toggle     # TODO: Only toggle is supported for now. We could support all HTML inputs: text_input, select...
  #     label: Debug     # optionnal
  #     name: show_debug # required
  #     default: false   # required

   # Decides what to do when asked to re-run a test for which we already have results
   # action_on_existing: run          # redo both the run and postprocessing
   ##                  | postprocess  # redo the postprocessing
   ##                  | sync         # reads `metrics.json` to make sure the database is up to date
   ##                  | skip         # continue to the next test


# # After the build, you must define the "artifacts" needed to run your software:
# # binaries, libraries, sources, configuration files... To save them:
# #   $ qa save-artifacts
# # Note: .qatools.yaml and qatools/ are saved automatically
# artifacts:
#   configurations:
#     glob: configurations/*.json
#   binary:
#     glob: 'build/sample_project'


# Bit accuray tests will look for files matching those glob patterns
bit_accuracy:
  # In order to compare file hashes/sizes between Linux and Windows, text files need to have end of lines normalized.
  # If you provide a list of patterns for plaintext files, the rest will be considered binary
  # plaintext:
  #   - '*.txt'
  #   - '*.cde'
  #   - '*.hex'
  #   - '*.dvs'
  #   - '*.iir'
  # If you provide a list of patterns for binary files, the rest will be considered plaintext
  # binary:
  #   - '*.raw'
  # If you provide both plaintext and binary patterns, you'll get an error.
  # patterns:
  #   - output.jpg
  #   - '*.txt'
  # ignore:
  #  - XXXX
  # if the CI for commit you compare against failed, you can decide to compare against its first parent
  # on_reference_failed_ci: compare-first-parent
  # after that many "replacement commits", fail
  # max_parents_depth: 5
  # you can choose the CI stage that defines failure. By default, we use gitlab's global commit status
  # failed_ci: qa-tests
